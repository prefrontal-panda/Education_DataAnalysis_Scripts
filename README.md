# Python_Scripts
For storing miscellaneous python scripts.

Currently, this repo contains:
1. Basic_dashboard.py - used to store code for building a Shiny for Python app. This app renders a basic dashboard showing barplots and summary statistics.
2. campus_function.py - contains various functions for future calling in other scripts.
3. Calendar Event Population.txt - contains code used to dynamically add events to a calendar grid (see notes below).
4. Dashboard_codeForShiny.py - contains code to run in Shiny for Python. Makes a dashboard for analysis and visualisation purposes.
5. DataFormatting.py - used to clean a folder of .csv files and concatenate them for further use.
6. NAPLAN_CampusLevelAnalysis.ipynb - used to run comparative analysis of a school's NAPLAN performance relative to the national performance. Outputs a html file.
7. NAPLAN_StudOutcomeLvl_DataFormatting.py - script to format outcome-level NAPLAN data into analysis-friendly format.
8. PAT_DataFormatting.ipynb - used to format PAT data obtained from OARS for uploading to database.


**NOTE:** The *Calendar Event Population.txt* file is built to function alongside a self-made dynamic calendar (itself based on Spreadsheet Life's 'How to Build a Dynamic Calendar in Google Sheets' video on youtube.
